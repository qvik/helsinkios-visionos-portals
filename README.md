# HelsinkiOS Portals Demo

This application demonstrates the use of portals in visionOS.

It was developed as a demo for HelsinkiOS / Spring of 2024.

# Notes

As an obvious improvement, the images and videos used should be stereoscopic. This kind of test material is rather hard to come by (for free) though!
